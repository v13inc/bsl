BSL: A silly little language
============================

BSL is a code-golfed forth-like interpeter written in 50ish 
lines of code. It supports basic math operators: */+-, quotes
and a few functions: clear and print.

print "Hello, world!"
print 'Hello, world!'
print `Hello,-world!
print / 2 * 2 20 + 2 2
